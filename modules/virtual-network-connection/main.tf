  # ✅ `response_export_values` IS SET. AVM spec TFFR4 is Severity-MUST and tagged

  # "even if empty".
  #
  # `[]` is the right value: nothing downstream reads a response-only property. Consumers
  # take `.id` and `.name`, both of which AzAPI exposes natively, and the computed-output rule keeps a
  # computed `.output` out of a module output.
  #
  # ⛔ NO `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [response_export_values] }` -- WITHDRAWN, AND IT MUST
  # NOT COME BACK. This site is "armed": `ignore_body_changes`/`ignore_null_property` leave
  # `body` free, so `skip.CanSkipExternalRequest` is false and a PUT does occur. Pinning
  # `response_export_values` here reproduces BUG 3: the pin freezes `plan.Output` to the stale
  # null-derived default projection while the writer still PUTs at adoption, so the applied
  # output disagrees with the planned one -> "Error: Provider produced inconsistent result
  # after apply" on first apply after upgrade. Do not copy this withdrawal onto a Class A
  # (fully silent) writer -- there, pinning costs nothing extra since no PUT happens, and BUG 3
  # cannot fire either way.
  #
  # `avm_azapi_response_export_values_required` fires on ABSENCE and is now satisfied. It
  # runs at `severity = "notice"` under the pinned AVM base tflint config, as do all eight
  # enabled `avm_*` rules, so a green `avm pr-check` is NOT evidence of MUST compliance.

# The provider migration is IN PLACE: same module, same `for_each`/`count`
# boundary, same keys, so every move is a whole-resource move and the consumer
# only bumps the module version. Plan with a normal refresh -- see
# `docs/upgrade-guide.md`; `-refresh=false` hits azapi#1227 and plans a replace.
