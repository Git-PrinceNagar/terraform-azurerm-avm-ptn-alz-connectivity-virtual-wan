# The output shapes are unchanged from the AzureRM version: both are LISTS built by iterating
# the resource, so the ordering and cardinality a consumer sees are the same. What changes is
# the element type of `resource` -- an `azapi_resource` object rather than an
# `azurerm_express_route_connection` one, so per-attribute reads such as `.routing_weight` are
# no longer available. Nothing inside this repository reads them; `modules/virtual-wan` uses
# this module for its side effect only.
