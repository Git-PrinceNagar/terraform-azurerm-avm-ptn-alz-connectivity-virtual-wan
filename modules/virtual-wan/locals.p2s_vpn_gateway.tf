  # AzureRM's Create builds `VpnServerConfigurationProperties` as a STRUCT LITERAL

  #

  #                                      returns NIL for an empty list -- the one field that
  #                                      can legitimately be absent
  #   VpnClientRootCertificates    L339  expandVpnServerConfigurationClientRootCertificates
  #                                      L644-L656, `make(..., 0)` then `return &slice`
  #   VpnClientRevokedCertificates L340  expandVpnServerConfigurationClientRevokedCertificates
  #                                      L684-L696, same shape

  # So `vpnClientRevokedCertificates: []`, `vpnClientIpsecPolicies: []` and `vpnProtocols: []`
  # were part of EVERY create request AzureRM sent, even though this module exposes no input
  # for any of them, and they stay part of this one. Dropping them would be a silent
  # behaviour change on the first apply after the provider migration.
  #
  # 🔴 `vpnProtocols` is Optional AND Computed on the AzureRM schema (L256-L264). AzureRM sent
  # `[]` at create and then, because `d.HasChange("vpn_protocols")` was never true for a
  # consumer of THIS module, never touched it again -- ARM's computed value was left alone
  # from that point on. The merge writer below reproduces that by NOT declaring it. See the
  # note there; declaring it as `[]` would WIPE the live protocol list.
  #
  # 🔴 RADIUS IS NOT REPRODUCED AND CANNOT BE. `var.p2s_gateway_vpn_server_configurations`
  # exposes no `radius` block, so `expandVpnServerConfigurationRadius` always returned nil for
  # a consumer of this module and the whole `if supportsRadius` branch (L353-L366) was dead.
  # `radiusServerSecret`, `radiusServerAddress`, `radiusServers`,
  # `radiusClientRootCertificates` and `radiusServerRootCertificates` are therefore absent
  # here for the same reason they were absent before: there is no input that produces them.
  # Setting `vpn_authentication_types = ["Radius"]` failed under AzureRM with
  # "`radius` must be specified..." (L355) and now fails at ARM instead. Unchanged behaviour,
  # different error text.
  #
  # `publicCertData` is NOT in this body. It is lifted into `sensitive_body`; see

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------ the certificate data
  # 🔴 `public_cert_data` IS CARRIED IN `sensitive_body`, WITH `sensitive_body_version` LEFT
  # NULL -- the same treatment `shared_key` gets in `modules/site-to-site-gateway-connection`.
  #
  #
  # ⚠️ AND IT IS A DELIBERATE DEPARTURE FROM AZURERM, NOT PARITY. `public_cert_data` is NOT
  # marked `Sensitive` on the AzureRM schema -- the ONLY `Sensitive: true` in
  # `vpn_server_configuration_resource.go` is at L205, on `radius.server.secret`, which this
  # module does not expose. AzureRM stored the certificate data in plain state and printed it
  # in plans. Moving it to `sensitive_body` is strictly more conservative, and the cost is
  # stated where it is paid:
  #
  #   1. Supplying `client_root_certificate` now requires TERRAFORM 1.11 OR LATER, because
  #      `sensitive_body` is write-only. Leaving it unset does not. `terraform.tf` still
  #      declares `required_version = "~> 1.7"`, so a consumer on 1.7-1.10 who sets a root
  #      certificate gets a Terraform-level error rather than a quiet downgrade.
  #   2. The value leaves state, so `terraform state show` no longer returns it.
  #
  # AzAPI merges `sensitive_body` into `body` before the request is built, matching list items
  # by their `name` property (`utils/json.go` `mergeObjectAtPath` L79-L104, identifier key
  # defaulted to `"name"` by `listIdentifierKeyForPath` L270-L279). The body above already
  # carries the matching `name`, so the two halves rejoin on the wire.
  #
  # ⭐ `sensitive_body_version` IS DELIBERATELY NOT SET AND NOT EXPOSED AS AN INPUT. Measured
  # for `shared_key` in testing: with the version NULL, azapi hashes the sensitive body into
  # Terraform private state and detects rotation on its own; with a version SET and not
  # bumped, a later apply that changes anything else sends an EMPTY array for the path and
  # wipes the live list. The null regime is both the detecting one and the safe one. The full
  # write-up is in `modules/site-to-site-gateway-connection/main.tf`.

  # Exactly the properties AzureRM's Update was able to change in place, and no others.

  # `payload := existing.Model`, with every field behind `d.HasChange`:
  #
  #   azure_active_directory_authentication  L487-L489 -> properties.aadAuthenticationParameters
  #   client_revoked_certificate             L491-L493 -> no input on this module
  #   client_root_certificate                L495-L497 -> properties.vpnClientRootCertificates
  #   ipsec_policy                           L499-L501 -> no input on this module
  #   vpn_protocols                          L503-L505 -> no input on this module
  #   vpn_authentication_types               L529-L531 -> properties.vpnAuthenticationTypes
  #   radius                                 L533-L558 -> no input on this module
  #   tags                                   L571-L573 -> tags
  #
  # The four rows with no input on this module are NOT declared here. That is parity, not an
  # omission: `d.HasChange` could never be true for them, so AzureRM never wrote them after
  # create either. It is also the SAFE choice, and for `vpnProtocols` it is the only safe one:
  #
  # 🔴 DECLARING `vpnProtocols: []` HERE WOULD WIPE THE LIVE PROTOCOL LIST. `mergeObjectAtPath`
  # short-circuits on an empty array -- `if len(oldValue) == 0 || len(newArr) == 0 { return
  # newArr }` (`utils/json.go` L62-L64) -- so an empty new array REPLACES the live one rather
  # than merging into it. `vpnProtocols` is Computed, so ARM populates it; sending `[]` on
  # every day-2 edit would clear it every time.
  #
  # Everything else on this resource is ForceNew and so could never appear in an AzureRM
  # update: `name` (L47), `resource_group_name` (L51, `commonschema.ResourceGroupName()`) and
  # `location` (L53, `commonschema.Location()`). All three are native replacement triggers on
  # `azapi_resource` and none of them is in the ignore list below, so parity holds without any
  # extra machinery. See the "NO PRECONDITIONS" note on the merge writer.
  # 🔴 `tags` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT FROM THIS BODY AS OF 0.19.0. It used to be spliced in
  # below with `try(value.tags, null) != null ? { tags = value.tags } : {}` -- carried as a
  # BODY KEY because `azapi_update_resource` has no `tags` attribute -- and that is what made
  # REG-1: the merge is additive PER KEY and preserves every undeclared key of the live object
  # unconditionally (`utils/json.go` L52-L53), so it could add and change a tag but never
  # REMOVE one, while AzureRM's Update assigned the WHOLE tag map (`tags.Expand`, L571-L573).
  # Observed in testing on the vpnGateway. ✅ FIXED IN 0.19.0: tags now travel on
  # `azapi_resource_action.p2s_gateway_vpn_server_configuration_tags` in `main.p2s_vpn_gateway.tf`,
  # which
  # PUTs at `Microsoft.Resources/tags/default` and REPLACES the whole tag set. There is exactly
  # one tag writer per address after create, and it is not this one. The `merge()` wrapper is
  # kept because the splice was its only other argument and a future conditional key would want
  # it back.

  #
  # WHY IT EXISTS. `azapi_resource`'s update path is guarded by
  # `skip.CanSkipExternalRequest(plan, state, "update")`, which reflects over

  # `state.body`" -- the moment any field WITHOUT a `skip_on:"update"` tag

  # create-only guarantee holds only if every such field is pinned.
  #
