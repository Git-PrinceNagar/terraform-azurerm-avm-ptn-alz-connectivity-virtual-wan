# Why this file exists
# --------------------
# `main.p2s_vpn_gateway.tf` migrates the last two AzureRM resources in this module, and it
# does so with TWO DIFFERENT SHAPES:
#
#   `Microsoft.Network/vpnServerConfigurations`  candidate 1 -- a create-only `azapi_resource`
#                                                plus an `azapi_update_resource` merge writer,
#                                                because it owns a child collection
#                                                (`properties.configurationPolicyGroups`) that
#                                                a full PUT would DELETE.
#   `Microsoft.Network/p2sVpnGateways`           a plain `azapi_resource`, because it owns none.
#
# The shape IS the safety property, so it is asserted here rather than left to a comment: an
# edit that collapses the pair into a single writer, or that adds a needless second writer to
# the gateway, has to fail a test rather than a live deployment.
#
# The second thing this file exists for is the apply-time bug class: an apply failed in an earlier test
# after 85 minutes because `length(try(x, []))` let a NULL reach `length()`. `terraform
# validate` is a type check, not an evaluation, and `terraform plan` never evaluated the `for`
# body because the collection was unknown. Every run below gives every input a KNOWN value, so
# the locals are forced to evaluate at plan time.
#
# 🔴 A NOTE ON `command = plan`, BECAUSE IT IS A KNOWN TRAP AND NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
# A `precondition` that reads a resource attribute reads STATE, so inside a plan-only run
# there is no prior state and the check compares the configuration against itself and passes
# unconditionally -- a green plan-only suite would be a FALSE NEGATIVE. That trap does not
# apply here, because this module declares NO preconditions on either P2S resource. It
# declares none because `azurerm_vpn_server_configuration` has NO body-level ForceNew field:
# `grep -n ForceNew internal/services/network/vpn_server_configuration_resource.go` at
# 5782a75422c68a0d0804ac16d97dcaf3df5ee2fa returns a single hit, L47 (`name`), plus
# `resource_group_name` L51 and `location` L53 via commonschema -- all three of which map to
# native AzAPI ForceNew attributes (`name`, `parent_id`, `location`) that are deliberately
# ABSENT from the full writer's ignore list. The assertion on that absence is below, and it is
# what keeps this reasoning true.
#
# The file still OPENS with a `command = apply` run, because plan-only cannot prove the graph
# converges, and the apply-time bug this file targets was an APPLY-time evaluation failure that
# plan never reached. Every later run is `plan` and executes against the state that run leaves
# behind.
#
# `mock_provider` means no Azure calls, no credentials and no cost.

  # ⚠️ REQUIRED FOR `command = apply`, AND IT IS A LIE THAT HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD.
  # Without this block the mock provider invents an 8-character random string for every

# `terraform plan` is not a proof that `terraform apply` works. The earlier apply failure
# got 85 minutes into an apply before `length(null)` blew up, because the plan had deferred
# that expression: `validate` is a type check and `plan` skipped an unknown collection. A
# plan-only suite is structurally incapable of catching that class of bug.
#
# This run also exercises the one thing the candidate-1 pair cannot show at plan time: that the
# merge writer's `resource_id` -- which references the full writer's computed `id` and is
# therefore UNKNOWN in every plan -- is actually accepted once it resolves. That check found a
# real failure the first time it was run; see the `mock_resource` note above.
