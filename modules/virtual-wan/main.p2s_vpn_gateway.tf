# TWO RESOURCES, TWO DIFFERENT SHAPES, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS MEASURED.
#
# The choice between "a plain `azapi_resource`" and "candidate 1" is not a style
# call. It is driven by whether the ARM type owns a CHILD COLLECTION inside its
# own body -- a body path holding a collection of resources ARM ALSO exposes as
# a separate child type. A full PUT that does not declare such a path DELETES
# its contents; that is measured, not inferred (measured).

#   `p2sVpnGateways`          L126-L134   ZERO child-collection paths.

#                                plus an `azapi_update_resource` merge writer.
#
# `unmeasured` is deliberately treated as hazardous: shape does not predict
# ARM's behaviour (the isolated measurements falsified that), so the safe shape is taken until
# a post-apply child-count readback says otherwise.

  # THAT IS CORRECT HERE RATHER THAN A COMPROMISE.
  #
  # `azurerm_vpn_server_configuration` has exactly THREE ForceNew properties and NONE of them
  # lives in `body`: `name` (L47), `resource_group_name` (L51) and `location` (L53). AzAPI
  # replaces natively on all three -- they map to `name`, `parent_id` and `location`, none of
  # which is in `lifecycle.ignore_changes` below. There is nothing left for a replacement
  # trigger to do. Verified by `grep -n ForceNew vpn_server_configuration_resource.go`, which
  # returns a single hit at L47, and cross-checked against the Update function, which handles
  # every other schema field behind `d.HasChange`.
  #
  # ==========================================================================================
  # ✅ `response_export_values` IS SET, AND IT IS `[]`. AVM spec TFFR4 is Severity-MUST and
  # tagged Class-Pattern, so it binds this module: an AzAPI resource MUST declare the
  # attribute, "even if empty". The repo-wide removal at 3ef4bc8 breached that MUST and
  # has been RETRACTED; see `docs/upgrade-guide.md`.
  #
  # WHY `[]`. Nothing downstream reads a response-only property; `outputs.tf` exposes only
  # `.id`, which AzAPI provides natively, and the computed-output rule keeps a computed `.output` out of a
  # module output.
  #
  # 🔴 IT IS ONLY SAFE BECAUSE `ignore_changes` SILENCES IT. The attribute carries NO
  # `skip_on` tag (`azapi_resource.go` L77), so at ADOPTION the imported state holds `null`
  # while the config holds `[]` -- `[]` is not `null`, so that is a difference -- and it alone
  # would drag the resource into `["update"]` and PUT the stale `state.body`. On
  # THIS resource that PUT drops `properties.configurationPolicyGroups`.
  # `response_export_values` is in `local.vpn_server_configuration_full_writer_ignored_
  # attributes` and in the `lifecycle` block below, which keeps the prior value and removes
  # the diff. NEVER declare this attribute on an `azapi_resource` without that matching
  # `ignore_changes` entry.
  #
  # 🔴 A FUTURE CHANGE TO THIS EXPORT LIST NEEDS ITS OWN MIGRATION. `ignore_changes` pins
  # the prior value, so editing the list is a NO-OP on an already-managed configuration until
  # a state operation (`terraform state rm` + re-import, or `-replace`) is performed.
  #
  # `avm_azapi_response_export_values_required` fires on ABSENCE and is now satisfied. It runs
  # at `severity = "notice"` under the pinned AVM base tflint config, as do all eight enabled
  # `avm_*` rules, so a green `avm pr-check` is NOT evidence of MUST compliance.

  # this resource sees drift on exactly the paths the MERGE writer declares
  # (`properties.vpnAuthenticationTypes`, `properties.aadAuthenticationParameters`,

  # verbatim. `tests/p2s_vpn_gateway.tftest.hcl` asserts the local's contents; the two must be

# DAY 2 -- THE MERGE WRITER FOR THE VPN SERVER CONFIGURATION.
#
# GETs the live object and merges into it, so a property it does not declare is
# PRESERVED rather than dropped (`utils.MergeObject` -> `mergeObjectAtPath`,
# `utils/json.go` L39-L105; the map branch at L45-L58 is the one that keeps
# `properties.configurationPolicyGroups`).
#
# 🔴 NO PRECONDITIONS, AND THE EMPTY LIST IS A MEASURED RESULT, NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
#
# The candidate-1 hazard a precondition guards against is a BODY field that
# AzureRM marked ForceNew: with `ignore_changes = [body]` on the full writer,
# such a field would be changed IN PLACE by this merge writer where AzureRM
# would have destroyed and recreated the resource, silently.
# `azurerm_vpn_server_configuration` HAS NO SUCH FIELD.
# `grep -n ForceNew internal/services/network/vpn_server_configuration_resource.go`
# at 5782a75422c68a0d0804ac16d97dcaf3df5ee2fa returns ONE line:
#
#   L47   `name`
#
# plus two more that are ForceNew by construction rather than by a literal in
# this file:
#
#   L51   `resource_group_name`   `commonschema.ResourceGroupName()`
#   L53   `location`              `commonschema.Location()`
#
# All three are RESOURCE-LEVEL, not body-level: they map to `name`, `parent_id`
# and `location` on `azapi_resource`, all three of which AzAPI replaces on
# natively and NONE of which is in the full writer's `ignore_changes` list. A
# consumer who renames the configuration, moves it to another resource group or
# changes its region gets a REPLACEMENT out of AzAPI, exactly as they got one
# out of AzureRM. Cross-checked against `resourceVPNServerConfigurationUpdate`
# (L462-L580): every other schema field on the resource is handled there behind
# a `d.HasChange` guard, which is only possible for a field that is NOT
# ForceNew.
#
# So there is no in-place change this writer can make that AzureRM would have
# refused, and a precondition here would be dead code advertising a guarantee
# it does not provide. If a future api-version or provider version adds a
# ForceNew body field, this is the block it belongs on.
#
# 🔴 Its `Delete` is an EMPTY FUNCTION (`azapi_update_resource.go` L676-L678):
# destroying this resource makes NO ARM call and silently leaves the live change
# in place. That is a teardown hazard, not a day-2 one, and it belongs in the

# DAY 2 -- THE TAG WRITER FOR THE VPN SERVER CONFIGURATION. REG-1'S REMEDY.
# New in 0.19.0.
#
# 🔴 WHY A SEPARATE RESOURCE AT ALL. `azapi_update_resource` is a MERGE writer,
# and the merge preserves every undeclared key of the LIVE object
# unconditionally -- `mergeObjectAtPath`'s map branch, `utils/json.go`
# L52-L53, `} else { res[key] = value }`. So a merge writer can add a tag and
# change a tag but can NEVER REMOVE one: dropping a key from
# `p2s_gateway_vpn_server_configurations[*].tags` produced a PUT that silently
# re-sent the live tag. That was REG-1, observed in testing, a regression against
# azurerm 4.x, whose Update assigned the WHOLE tag map (`tags.Expand`,
# L571-L573). A PUT at `Microsoft.Resources/tags/default` REPLACES the whole
# tag set instead, which is what that assignment did.
#
# ✅ OBSERVED IN TESTING: this PUT DELETED the `stage` tag from a live
# VPN gateway, left `costCentre` and `purpose` intact, and issued exactly ONE
# ARM write.
#
# 🔴 THIS ADDRESS TAGS THE VPN SERVER CONFIGURATION, NOT THE P2S GATEWAY.
# `azapi_resource.p2s_gateway` below is a PLAIN `azapi_resource` whose `tags`
# argument drives a whole-object PUT on every change -- neither `body` nor
# `tags` is in its `ignore_changes` list -- so tag REMOVAL already worked
# there and it needs no action of its own. `tests/p2s_vpn_gateway.tftest.hcl`
# asserts that premise so it cannot regress silently. Do NOT add a second
# action for the gateway.
#
# 🔴 WHY `azapi_resource_action` AND NOT `azapi_resource`.
# `Microsoft.Resources/tags/default` is an ARM SINGLETON THAT ALWAYS EXISTS
#, so `azapi_resource` can never CREATE it -- there is nothing to
# create, only something to PUT. Do not "improve" this back into an
# `azapi_resource`.
#
# 🔴 WHY `depends_on`. Measured twice: the tags PUT drives the
# resource provider but issues NO write against the parent -- the activity log
# for the window shows only `Microsoft.Resources/tags/write` -- and the RP then
# sits internally in `Updating` for ~4m30s AFTER Terraform has returned. Two
# writes racing on one parent produce a 409. `depends_on` has no per-instance
# granularity, so it serialises the whole address rather than key-by-key; that
# is stricter than required and is the only granularity Terraform offers.
#
# ⚠️ OUT-OF-BAND TAGS ARE NOT DETECTED: this resource's Read issues NO GET
# (`azapi_resource_action_resource.go` L424-L435), so a tag set outside
# Terraform never appears as drift -- it is simply overwritten on the next
# apply. Weaker than AzureRM's drift detection, DELIBERATE, and recorded as a
# named difference in `docs/upgrade-guide.md`.
#
# ⚠️ Its `Delete` is a NO-OP unless `when == "destroy"` (L413-L421), so
# removing an entry issues no tags DELETE. Harmless here: the full writer
# deletes the configuration and its tags go with it.
#
# The tag expression is the one the merge writer used before this resource
# existed, with one deliberate change: a NULL now yields `{}` rather than
# omitting the key, because this body is not a merge and an omitted key would
# mean "PUT no tags at all". `{}` is also AzureRM parity -- `tags.Expand(nil)`
# returns a pointer to an EMPTY map and never nil.

  # NOT COME BACK. This site is "armed": `ignore_body_changes`/`ignore_null_property` leave
  # `body` free, so `skip.CanSkipExternalRequest` is false and a PUT does occur. Pinning
  # `response_export_values` here reproduces BUG 3: the pin freezes `plan.Output` to the stale
  # null-derived default projection while the writer still PUTs at adoption, so the applied
  # output disagrees with the planned one -> "Error: Provider produced inconsistent result
  # after apply" on first apply after upgrade. Do not copy this withdrawal onto a Class A
  # (fully silent) writer -- there, pinning costs nothing extra since no PUT happens, and BUG 3
  # cannot fire either way.
  #
  # 🔴 This also means `tags` and `body` were never in scope for a lifecycle ignore list on
  # this resource -- there is none. A changed tag map drives a whole-object PUT and REMOVING a
  # tag works, which is precisely what the four candidate-1 merge writers could not do (REG-1).
  # `tests/tags_writer.tftest.hcl` applies twice -- two tags, then one -- to prove the removal
  # still reaches the resource, so this cannot regress silently.

  # tflint-ignore: avm_azapi_resource_tags_required // the rule wants exactly `tags = var.tags`. These are PER-INSTANCE tags carried on a collection variable, which is the v0.17.2 public API; forcing a single module-wide `var.tags` is a BREAKING interface change. Tracked for the next major.

# The provider migration is IN PLACE: same module, same `for_each`/`count`
# boundary, same keys, so every move is a whole-resource move and the consumer
# only bumps the module version. Plan with a normal refresh -- see
# `docs/upgrade-guide.md`; `-refresh=false` hits azapi#1227 and plans a replace.
