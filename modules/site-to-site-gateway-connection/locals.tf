  # ⭐⭐ OPTION A (per-link `shared_key_version`) WAS REMOVED HERE.
  #
  # It was added on 2025-09-25 to solve a problem THAT DOES NOT EXIST. The premise was:
  # "rotation is SILENT, because `sensitive_body` is write-only so Terraform cannot diff it."
  # That premise was never measured. It is false.
  #
  # MEASURED (live): with NO version set, changing
  # `shared_key` alone plans `0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy`, while the identical config
  # with the key left alone plans `No changes`. AzAPI detects the rotation on its own.
  # `ephemeralBodyChangeInPlan` (internal/services/resource.go:291) has THREE branches, and the
  # third hashes the sensitive body into Terraform PRIVATE STATE and diffs against it. Setting
  # a version does not add detection -- it REPLACES it: azapi_resource.go:1106-1114 stores the
  # hash only `if plan.SensitiveBodyVersion.IsNull()`, and DELETES it otherwise.
  #
  # 🔴 AND SETTING A VERSION IS ACTIVELY DESTRUCTIVE. With a version set and NOT bumped, a
  # later apply that changes anything else on the connection sends
  # `properties.vpnLinkConnections: []` and wipes every link. Measured:
  # `400 MissingLinkConnectionForVpnConnection` -- only ARM's minimum-one-link rule prevented
  # data loss, and every static gate had passed, because the emptying happens inside the
  # provider at APPLY time. The chain: an unbumped version makes `paths` empty, so
  # `FilterFields` (utils/json.go:422) returns `{properties:{vpnLinkConnections:[]}}` -- its
  # map branch collapses an emptied map to nil at L438-440, but its ARRAY branch at L442-450
  # has NO such guard, so `[]` survives as non-nil -- and `mergeObjectAtPath` then sees an
  # empty array with no identifier whose length differs from the live list, and takes the
  # `return newArr` branch, REPLACING the real links with nothing.
  #
  # So the null regime is both the detecting one and the safe one, and it is now the only one
  # this module offers.
  #
  # ⭐⭐ `var.sensitive_body_version` WAS REMOVED TOO.
  # It was kept for one commit on the argument that it is normative -- SKILL.md L222 says to
  # "use `sensitive_body_version` to make changes detectable without persisting secret values"
  # -- and that removing a normative attribute is a larger deviation than documenting a
  # hazardous one. That argument was overruled, correctly:
  #
  #   1. PARITY DOES NOT NEED IT. The azurerm module had no equivalent input. Removing it
  #      restores parity rather than departing from it, and nothing in this repo ever set it.
  #   2. IT CARRIES THE SAME DEFECT. Any stale entry a consumer leaves in the map reproduces
  #      exactly the wipe above; the hazard is in the attribute, not in how we derived it.
  #   3. IT HAS A WORSE VARIANT. A leaf path such as
  #      `"properties.vpnLinkConnections[0].properties.sharedKey"` -- the intuitive thing to
  #      write -- makes `FilterFields` strip every sibling it was not told to keep, INCLUDING
  #      `name`. The merge then has no identifier to match on and replaces the whole live list
  #      with that one stripped element. No staleness required, no empty array involved, and
  #      the documentation does not warn against it.
  #   4. THE PREMISE OF L222 IS ALREADY SATISFIED. "Make changes detectable" is the goal; with
  #      the version null, azapi detects them by itself. Measured: rotating the
  #      key with no version planned `1 to change`, while the same edit with a version set
  #      planned `No changes`. Null is not a weaker form of compliance here; it is the only
  #      form that works.
  #
  # Recorded as a deliberate deviation from `.github/skills/avm-tf-azapi/SKILL.md` L222 in
  # `MIGRATION-DEVIATIONS.md`. The provider defect is written up separately.

  # Per-resource timeout defaults. `var.timeouts` keeps its published shape -- same name, same
  # four attributes, same types -- but its attributes no longer carry a blanket `30m`/`5m`
  # default. An attribute the consumer leaves unset now falls back to the default of the
  # AzureRM resource this module replaced. A consumer who sets `var.timeouts` today is
  # unaffected.
