          # literal for exactly that reason — it is not a knob, it is AzureRM's behaviour.
          #
          # Note this is sent at CREATE only, in both providers: AzureRM's Update mutates it only
          # behind `if d.HasChange("branch_to_branch_traffic_enabled")` (L276), and with no
          # variable to change, that was never true. The merge writer below therefore omits it,
