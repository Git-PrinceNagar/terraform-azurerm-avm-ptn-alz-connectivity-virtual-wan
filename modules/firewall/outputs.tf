# ===========================================================================
# `private_ip_address` and `public_ip_addresses` ARE RESTORED. The migration
# regression that made them `null` was closed on.
#
# WHAT THE REGRESSION WAS. Both are ARM-RESPONSE-ONLY data. AzureRM populated
# them from the `Computed` schema fields `virtual_hub.0.private_ip_address`
# and `virtual_hub.0.public_ip_addresses` (`firewall_resource.go` L214-222,
# flattened at L804-819) out of the CreateOrUpdate/Read response. AzAPI
# surfaces response data in exactly one place -- the computed `output`
# attribute -- and `output` is populated by exactly one thing,
# `response_export_values`. This module will not put a NON-EMPTY export list
# on `azapi_resource.fw`: the attribute is non-skippable (`azapi_resource.go`
# L77) and the computed-output rule rules a computed `.output` out of a module output
# anyway. So the values were published as `null`.
#
# WHY THEY ARE NOT NULL ANY MORE. `main.tf` adds a READ-ONLY
# `data "azapi_resource" "fw_hub_ip_addresses"` with
# `response_export_values = ["properties.hubIPAddresses"]`. It was decided
# decided that a DATA SOURCE is exempt from The computed-output rule: it has no writer, no
# `state.body` and no update path, so there is no adoption diff for
# `response_export_values` to poison. That decision is recorded in full on the
# data source itself -- read it before touching this file.
#
# ✅ SEPARATELY, AND NOW: `azapi_resource.fw` and
# `azapi_resource.diagnostic_setting` DO declare `response_export_values`,
# because AVM spec TFFR4 is Severity-MUST and Class-Pattern and requires the
# attribute on every AzAPI resource "even if empty". They declare `[]`, and
# each pairs it with a `response_export_values` entry in
# `lifecycle.ignore_changes`, which is what removes the null-vs-`[]` adoption
# diff that would otherwise force a stale-body PUT.
#
# ⛔ The NON-EMPTY list is still for the DATA SOURCE ONLY. Giving a writer a
# real export path, or declaring the attribute on a writer WITHOUT the
# matching `ignore_changes` entry, reopens the stale PUT. And a
# future change to any export list in this module needs its own migration,
# because `ignore_changes` pins the prior value: the new list will not take
# effect without a state operation.
#
# The names, types and semantics below are the pre-migration ones, taken from
# `modules/firewall/outputs.tf` at commit 589d10e^ (the last azurerm-based
# revision): `private_ip_address` is a map of firewall key to a single
# address string, `public_ip_addresses` a map of firewall key to a list of
# address strings, and both collapse to `null` when `var.firewalls` is null.
# ===========================================================================

# Null-safety for both outputs lives in `locals.tf`
# (`firewall_private_ip_addresses` / `firewall_public_ip_addresses`).
