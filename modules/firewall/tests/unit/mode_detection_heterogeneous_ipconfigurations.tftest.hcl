# Guards modules/firewall/locals.tf's existing_customer_mode against a heterogeneous ipConfigurations
# response. For a secured-hub firewall with two customer public IPs, Azure's ipConfigurations response is
# a HETEROGENEOUS TUPLE: ip-a's properties object carries privateIPAddress (a
# string), ip-b's properties object entirely omits that key (ARM key-omission, not null) - alongside
# both elements' nested publicIPAddress objects. Terraform's coalesce() requires all arguments to convert
# to one common element type; this specific mix (a key present-with-string-value on one element, absent on
# the other, both nested under an object with its own nested object field) cannot be unified, so
# `coalesce(firewall.properties.ipConfigurations, [])` errors, and an enclosing try(..., []) would silently
# swallow that error and substitute an empty list. existing_customer_mode would then be computed over that
# empty list and evaluate to false - a genuine customer-mode firewall misclassified as "managed" - and
# the cross-mode guard in modules/firewall/main.tf's terraform_data.public_ip_mode precondition would
# reject an ordinary same-mode grow (adding a third customer IP) as though it were an illegal
# managed<->customer conversion.
#
# NOTE: this is NOT triggered by heterogeneity alone -
# a uniformly-shaped or superficially-"different" mock does not reproduce it, because Terraform's type
# unifier can still find a common object type for many mixed-but-compatible shapes. The trigger is
# specifically UNIFICATION-IMPOSSIBLE heterogeneity: one key present with a string value on one element,
# entirely absent (not null) on another, alongside a nested object field on every element. This fixture
# reproduces that exact shape, not merely "some heterogeneity."
