# The output shapes are unchanged from the AzureRM version: `resource` and `resource_id` are
# still LISTS built by iterating the resource, and `resource_object` is still a map keyed the
# same way with the same five attributes. What changes is the element type of `resource` -- an
# `azapi_resource` object rather than an `azurerm_express_route_gateway` one, so per-attribute
# reads such as `.scale_units` are no longer available on it. `resource_object` is the shape
# `modules/virtual-wan` actually consumes and it is preserved attribute for attribute.
#
# 🔴 NOTHING HERE READS `.output`. The computed-output rule: `azapi_resource.output` is Computed, so it goes
# unknown on any update and cascades `(known after apply)` into every consumer -- on this
# module that would make `express_route_gateway_id` unknown for every ExpressRoute connection
# and force a full PUT of each one. `scale_units` and `resource_group` are therefore projected
# from CONFIGURATION, and every child ID a consumer builds is built from `.id`, which stays
# known across an in-place update.
